Collusion in Algorithmic Competition: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains the code and resources for the project Collusion in Algorithmic Competition: A Machine Learning Approach. The project explores how machine learning algorithms can lead to collusive behaviours in competitive environments, with a focus on pricing strategies.

Introduction

In the age of artificial intelligence, the potential for algorithms to inadvertently or deliberately engage in collusion has become a significant concern. This project investigates the conditions under which machine learning algorithms might develop collusive strategies in competitive markets. By simulating various market scenarios and employing different reinforcement learning techniques, we aim to shed light on the dynamics of algorithmic collusion.
Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/JanHeymann/Collusion-in-algorithmic-competition-a-machine-learning-approach.git

Algorithm for thesis.ipynb 

It is possilbe to specify the market conditions via inputs.
Experiments

This repository includes various experimental setups to test different pricing strategies and reinforcement learning models. Key experiments involve:

    Comparing collusive vs. competitive behaviour under different learning algorithms
    Analysing the impact of exploration rates on price dynamics
    Evaluating the effects of punishment mechanisms on collusion

Results

The results include visualisations of price evolution, Q-values, and profit distributions, highlighting trends in algorithmic behaviour over time.
